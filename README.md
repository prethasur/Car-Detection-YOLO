# Car-Detection-YOLO
implementation of object detection on a car dataset using the very powerful YOLO model. 

TASKS :
1. Detect objects in a car detection dataset
2. Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
3. Implement intersection over union
4. Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning

Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016.
